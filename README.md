# OWL_AdvAttack
Adversarial attack with respect to the Ordered Weighted L1 (OWL) norm via the ProxLogBarrier framework.

The proximal operator for the OWL norm was taken from the implementation in the following repository:  https://github.com/cmazzaanthony/ccgowl

Currently the weights are pre-specified to fit the "Octagonal  Selection  and  Clustering  Algorithm  for  Regression" (OSCAR) regularizer, though changing this is straight-forward.
